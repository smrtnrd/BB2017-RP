  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination of elderly individuals is
                 recommended worldwide. Our aim was to review the evidence of
                 efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines in
                 individuals aged 65 years or older. METHODS: We searched five
                 electronic databases to December, 2004, in any language, for
                 randomised (n=5), cohort (n=49), and case-control (n=10)
                 studies, assessing efficacy against influenza (reduction in
                 laboratory-confirmed cases) or effectiveness against
                 influenza-like illness (reduction in symptomatic cases). We
                 expressed vaccine efficacy or effectiveness as a proportion,
                 using the formula VE=1-relative risk (RR) or VE*=1-odds ratio
                 (OR). We analysed the following outcomes: influenza,
                 influenza-like illness, hospital admissions, complications,
                 and deaths. FINDINGS: In homes for elderly individuals (with
                 good vaccine match and high viral circulation) the
                 effectiveness of vaccines against influenza-like illness was
                 23\% (95\% CI 6-36) and non-significant against influenza (RR
                 1.04, 0.43-2.51). Well matched vaccines prevented pneumonia
                 (VE 46\%, 30-58) and hospital admission (VE 45\%, 16-64) for
                 and deaths from influenza or pneumonia (VE 42\%, 17-59), and
                 reduced all-cause mortality (VE 60\%, 23-79). In elderly
                 individuals living in the community, vaccines were not
                 significantly effective against influenza (RR 0.19,
                 0.02-2.01), influenza-like illness (RR 1.05, 0.58-1.89), or
                 pneumonia (RR 0.88, 0.64-1.20). Well matched vaccines
                 prevented hospital admission for influenza and pneumonia (VE
                 26\%, 12-38) and all-cause mortality (VE 42\%, 24-55). After
                 adjustment for confounders, vaccine performance was improved
                 for admissions to hospital for influenza or pneumonia (VE*
                 27\%, 21-33), respiratory diseases (VE* 22\%, 15-28), and
                 cardiac disease (VE* 24\%, 18-30), and for all-cause mortality
                 (VE* 47\%, 39-54). INTERPRETATION: In long-term care
                 facilities, where vaccination is most effective against
                 complications, the aims of the vaccination campaign are
                 fulfilled, at least in part. However, according to reliable
                 evidence the usefulness of vaccines in the community is
                 modest.",

	Abstract = {Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex,
              high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key
              challenge in transforming health care. Various types of data have
              been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic
              health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are
              complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally
              unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning
              approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to
              obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and
              then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There
              are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated
              data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest
              advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective
              paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data.
              In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep
              learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on
              the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could
              be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved
              human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for
              improved methods development and applications, especially in
              terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen
              scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing
              holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge
              deep learning models and human interpretability.},

                   machine learning. To empower individual neurons, we recently
                   suggested that the current type of neurons could be upgraded
                   to 2nd order counterparts, in which the linear operation
                   between inputs to a neuron and the associated weights is
                   replaced with a nonlinear quadratic operation. A single 2nd
                   order neurons already has a strong nonlinear modeling
                   ability, such as implementing basic fuzzy logic operations.
                   In this paper, we develop a general backpropagation (BP)
                   algorithm to train the network consisting of 2nd-order

  abstract  = "A rolling analysis of a time series model is often used to
               assess the model’s stability over time. When analyzing financial
               time series data using a statistical model, a key assumption is
               that the parameters of the model are constant over time.
               However, the economic environment often changes considerably,
               and it may not be reasonable to assume that a model’s parameters
               are constant. A common technique to assess the constancy of a
               model’s parameters is to compute parameter estimates over a
               rolling window of a fixed size through the sample. If the
               parameters are truly constant over the entire sample, then the
               estimates over the rolling windows should not be too different.
               If the parameters change at some point during the sample, then
               the rolling estimates should capture this instability.",
